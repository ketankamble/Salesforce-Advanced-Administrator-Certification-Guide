**Build a solid mathematical foundation for training efficient deep neural networks	**

## What is this book about?
Most programmers and data scientists struggle with mathematics, having either overlooked or forgotten core mathematical concepts. This book uses Python libraries to help you understand the math required to build deep learning (DL) models.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the key mathematical concepts for building neural network models 
* Discover core multivariable calculus concepts 
* Improve the performance of deep learning models using optimization techniques 
* Cover optimization algorithms, from basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to the advanced Adam optimizer 
* Understand computational graphs and their importance in DL 
* Explore the backpropagation algorithm to reduce output error 
* Cover DL algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), sequence models, and generative adversarial networks (GANs)
